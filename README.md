## Inspiration

The lack of an all-purpose & all-in-one medical dashboard inspired me to work on CovImune. I have seem my own family and friends struggling to keep medical records, and the fact that every hospital has its own database makes it even more difficult for patients to keep track and submit records repeatedly.


## Built With:

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this project. I have used a couple of API's for setting up things such as: analysers, photos, animations and design. 
I used the Endless Medical API for one of the analysers. I used icons8, unsplash API and LottiePlayer API for the icons, images and animations respectively.


## What's next?

I plan to add more different types of analysers and make the alerts and reminders operational.
